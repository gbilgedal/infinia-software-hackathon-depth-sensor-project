# infinia-software-hackathon-depth-sensor-project

This project, Cycloduck, was created in a software hackathon organised by INFINIA and Kargakarga, on 17-18th of June, 2023 by GÃ¼nsu Bilge Dal and Emre Eren.

The name Cycloduck comes from the resemblance of the created product to a duck and a cyclops.

The aim of the project was to implement a wide ranged depth camera using a distance sensor and two servo motors as base structure. Due to it being more than a software project, two aspects will be mentioned in this README file.

For the hardware part, the distance sensor and servo were connected to the Arduino, a mini breadboard was also used for necessary purposes. Servo motors were programmed to control a 2-axis pan/tilt kit, then the distance sensor was set on the mentioned kit to scan a wide area. ROWS and COLUMS values were used to determine the movement, speed of the servo motors and the sensitivity of the depth camera.  
Then the data read was printed in a serial manner to be captured by the Python side of the project.

For the software part, data coming from the sensor were read and put in a 2D array and visualised with matplotlib. For optimization, gaussian filter and bilinear interpolation was applied to the data gathered.

The rows and columns values were set to 45x45 for demo purposes. Values can be changed for desired sensitivity and output. It is important to have same dimensions on both the Python and the Arduino side of the project.

Used Hardware:
- VL53l1X Time-of-Flight Distance
- 2 SG90 Mini Servo Motors 
- 2-Axis Pan/Tilt Kit
